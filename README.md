AirBnb dataset analysis using python


This notebook looks at using the dataset from AirBnb found at http://insideairbnb.com/. As always, there are several ways in which this dataset can be used to generate insights and I hope to explore 2 scenarios 

Scenario1:

I want to take my family for a trip to New York. I also happen to know abit of python and data engineering. 
My priorities are -
1. Safety
2. Cost
3. Popularity
Can I use this dataset to show me no more than a handful of properties to choose from around NYC area?

Scenario2:

from an investment point of view, I am interested to know the relationship between 
1. Popularity of a property and cost per night to see what are people ready to pay 
2. What areas are popular for short stay and long stay durations to enableme to choose an area for investing (if I had the money that is!..)
